     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### 4. **Start the Project**

   To run the project, you can serve the static files using one of the following methods:

   ### Option 1: Using `http-server` (Node.js)

   If you are using **Node.js**, you can install and use `http-server` to serve the files.

   - Install `http-server` globally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     ```

   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     http-server
     ```

   The project will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).

   ### Option 2: Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server

   If you prefer **Python**, you can use Python’s built-in HTTP server to serve static files.

   - Navigate to the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```

   This will serve the project at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
